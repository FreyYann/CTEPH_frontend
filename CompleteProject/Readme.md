<h1>REACT and FLASK</h1>
<br><br>
Hello In this container holds the react and flask application applicaiton
<br><br>
<h4>Front End (React Folder)</h4>
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>in React folder run npm install to get the node_module</li>
  <li>To run the front end us. npm start</li>
  <li>To compile to front end use.  npm run build</li>
  <li>The front end need to be in sink with the back end so go to your flask fold and run in your command prompt (python main.py) </li>
  <li>When you compile the front end with npm run build it will send a bundle.js file to the backend which is flask (this file is important) because it is your whole front end application </li>
  <li>run npm start and change the styling of the applicaton you can remove and anything if you want.</li>
  <li>The styling are seperated into components so it make it easy to modify if you want</li>
  <li>when changing the style while the server is going for the front end it does it auto-matically</li>
  <li>You should implement a route guard on the result route when their is no upload images</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h4>Back End (React Folder)</h4>
<br></br>
<ul>
<li>change the config file base on which operational system you are using (for me i had c:\path)</li>
  <li>The backend structure in my local is industry standard <li>
  <li>
    When doing locally make sure that the images are in the Flask/static/png and Flask/static/result files as well as the front End React/dist/static/_png and React/dist/static/_result  files (important to see your application locally)
  <li>
  <li>
    You guys should figure out a way to catch all routes in the backend so that it goes back to the index.html route.
  </li>
  
</ul>
peace out Nick
