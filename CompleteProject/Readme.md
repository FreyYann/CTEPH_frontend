<h1>Remake of the front end and back end. To make more modularize code<h1>
<br>
<p>
Sina. gave authority to change the backend structure</p>
<p>Billy. gave authority to work on the front end as fitted
</p>
<p>Alen. gave authority to make the front-end seperate  from the backend</p>
<br><br>
<h1>Important thing to note<h1/>
<br>

<p>You can run the application by going to Flask directory (cd Flask)  and run (python main.py)</p>
<p>There is a reqirement.txt file its just do (pip freeze > reqirement.txt) to update if you have any new install </p>
<p>
The front end is fully functional and works great all I need is the back end algorithm and the backend methods to be completed as they where before
<p>
<p>You do not need the File in the React folder it is only for development purposes.</p>

<p>
I realize you guys don't have much of a understanding on React so don't worry about that.
You can test your backend with the front end by using the browser console(left click mouse and click inspect then go to console while running server) for error message see if it transcend properly from the backend. You can use those error messages to check if it has been receive or not. When it is receive the correct functionality would be shown and you will be happy :)
